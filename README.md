# üìä Power BI Financial Sample Report

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development of an interactive, insightful Power BI report based on a fictional financial dataset. The dataset represents sales performance, profit margins, and business metrics across multiple countries, products, and market segments. The report was built to practice data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation using real-world techniques.

The project focuses on transforming raw Excel data into meaningful visual narratives to support business decision-making.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Steps Taken in Each Phase of the Report

### **Data Import & Cleaning**

* Connected the Power BI report to the Excel file (`Financial Sample from PowerBI.xlsx`).
* Verified and corrected data types for fields like Date, Sales, Profit, and COGS.
* Removed unnecessary columns to simplify the model.

### **Data Modeling**

* Only one primary table was used; no relationships were required due to the flat data structure.
* Ensured all fields were properly categorized (e.g., Date as Date, Product as Text).

### **Visualization Building**

* Created a bar chart for **Total Sales by Country** to compare market performance.
